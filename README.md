- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben LaFrance, I am a scientist with the Greater Yellowstone Network which is part of the National Park Service.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things related to national parks and science, but especially amphibians and water quality.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create R packages and maintain processing software appropriately.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate specifically on amphibians, occupancy modelling, water quality trend analysis, etc!
